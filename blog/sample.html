              Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father? Mmm... rest I need. Yes...
              rest. Yoda, I must know. Your father he is. Told you, did he? Yes.
              Unexpected this is, and unfortunate... Unfortunate that I know the
              truth? No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete
              was your training. Not ready for the burden were you. Well, I'm sorry.
              Remember, a Jedi's strength flows from the Force. But beware. Anger,
              fear, aggression. The dark side are they. Once you start down the
              dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny.

              Bring me Solo and the Wookiee. They will all suffer for this outrage.
              Han! Luke! Are you all right? Fine. Together again, huh? Wouldn't
              miss it. How are we doing? The same as always. That bad, huh?
              Where's Leia? I'm here. Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great
              Jabba the Hutt, has decreed that you are to be terminated immediately.
              Good, I hate long waits. You will therefore be taken to the Dune
              Sea and cast into the pit of Carkoon, the nesting place of the
              all-powerful Sarlacc. Doesn't sound so bad. In his belly, you will
              find a new definition of pain and suffering, as you are slowly
              digested over a thousand years. On second thought, let's pass on
              that, huh? You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last
              mistake you'll ever make.

              The data brought to us by the Bothan spies pinpoints the exact
              location of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that
              the weapon systems of this Death Star are not yet operational.
              With the Imperial Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain
              effort to engage us, it is relatively unprotected. But most
              important of all, we've learned that the Emperor himself is
              personally overseeing the final stages of the construction of this
              Death Star. Many Bothans died to bring us this information. Admiral
              Ackbar, please.

            <blockquote>
              Learn about the Force, Luke. Look, I can take you as far as Anchorhead.
              You can get a transport there to Mos Eisley or wherever you're going.
              You must do what you feel is right, of course.

              Master. Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. I told you not to admit him.
              I must be allowed to speak. He must be allowed to speak. You
              weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick.
              You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. Your mind powers
              will not work on me, boy. Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and
              his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's
              your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. Master
              Luke, you're standing on... There will be no bargain, young Jedi.
              I shall enjoy watching you die. Bascka! Oh, no! The Rancor!
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-heading">It's a trap!</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you. You no longer
              need those. Guards, leave us. I'm looking forward to completing your
              training. In time you will call me Master. You're gravely mistaken.
              You won't convert me as you did my father. Oh, no, my young Jedi.
              You will find that it is you who are mistaken...about a great many
              things. His lightsaber. Ah, yes, a Jedi's weapon. Much like your
              father's. By now you must know your father can never be turned from
              the dark side. So will it be with you. You're wrong. Soon I'll be
              dead...and you with me.

              Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. Intensify the forward

              I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I
              see a big light blur. There's nothing to see. I used to live here,
              you know. You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. Just stick
              close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. Oh...
              great! Soon you will learn to appreciate me. Oh, I'm terribly sor...
              Artoo! What are you doing here? Well, I can see you're serving drinks,
              but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and,
              if we're not careful, us too! Hmm. I wish I had your confidence.
              Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will
              die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great
              Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas.
